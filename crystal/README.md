# Crystal implementation

This is a worked example in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) based upon the Monte-Carlo kata, described [here](../README.md). It uses a docker image with a working crystal-lang development environment [sleepyfox/crystal:alpine3.12-crystal-0.34](https://hub.docker.com/r/sleepyfox/crystal).

Run the tests with:

    make test

Run a simulation with:

    make run
