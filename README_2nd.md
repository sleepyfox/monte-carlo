## Monte Carlo exercise, part 2

Our business has more historical data on how long tasks take in seconds, grouped by story size in points. Data set available [here](./project-stats.csv).

We are about to begin a larger project, which we have done some T-shirt sizing on (S, M or L) and we've correlated these T-shirt sizes to story point estimates.

Use the Monte-Carlo Method to estimate how long the project will take, given that we have:
* 7 Small stories (1-3 points)
* 5 Medium stories (5-8 points)
* 4 Large stories (13 points and above)

Use 10,000 runs of the simulator and output the data to a histogram as before.
