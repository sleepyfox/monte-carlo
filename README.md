# Anagram Kata
This is a worked example in Python based upon the Monte-Carlo kata.

Run the tests with:

    python test-monte-carlo.py

The source of the kata is the code dojo that @sleepyfox ran for the London Code Dojo - slides [here]()

The text of the kata at the link above is reproduced below:
